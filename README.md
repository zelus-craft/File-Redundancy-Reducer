File-Redundancy-Reducer
=======================

Description
-----------

File Redundancy Reducer (FRR) is a program used to help reduce the number of redundantly saved files on a computer.
            
In general, there is a time consuming problem with naming conventions of files downloaded and stored on a computer: files are not always easily distinguishable by their default filenames 
or thumbnails, so they are often manually categorized and organized.

FRR is a tool which helps make this categorization and organization process easier by listing which files have been saved redundantly and can be discarded safely.

How to Use
------------
1. Drag and Drop files/folders into the left pane to load them. Selecting files/folders through the Browse option works too.
2. The right panes will automatically update with the loaded files, listing which loaded files are unique and which are duplicates.
3. Click the 'Delete All Duplicate Files Found' button to delete the duplicates listed.
4. Click the 'Reset Files Loaded' button to reset the detected unique and duplicate files, which resets the program.

Download/Installation
------------

The portable Windows version of the program is available right here, on Github: 
<a href="https://github.com/zelus-craft/File-Redundancy-Reducer/raw/master/File%20Redundancy%20Reducer/File%20Redundancy%20Reducer%20Windows%20(exe).zip">Download</a>

Otherwise, clone this repository and run the .pyw, or unzip the .exe version (Windows).

Errata

File pathnames with some Jōyō kanji, Chinese, and Korean characters may not be loaded properly. Thanks UTF... :C
