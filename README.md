File-Redundancy-Reducer
=======================

Description
-----------

File Redundancy Reducer (FRR) is a program used to help reduce the number of redundantly saved files on a computer.
            
In general, there is a time consuming problem with naming conventions of files downloaded and stored on a computer: files are not always easily distinguishable by their default filenames 
or thumbnails, so they are often manually categorized and organized.

FRR is a tool which helps make this categorization and organization process easier by listing which files have been saved redundantly and can be discarded safely.
